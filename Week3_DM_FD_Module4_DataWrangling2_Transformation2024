In this context, you'll often hear the terms binning and bucketing.\n","\n","In short, Data binning and bucketing groups data in bins or buckets, in the sense that it replaces values contained into a small interval with a single representative value for that interval. It includes also dealing with missing values, formatting, normalization and standardization. That makes it a technique for data smoothing.\n","\n","The **difference** between binning and bucketing is:\n","* In **bucketing**, we define the boundaries for the categories ourselves. They don't have to be the same size.\n","* In **binning**, we define the number of categories, and the code distributes them evenly across our dataset, depending on whether we set the binning criterion to the number of data in each bin, or to the value of the data.\n","\n","On a technical level, we to convert numeric values to categorical or to sample (quantise) numeric values, sometimes using distance (remember distance from one of the previous modules?) and sometimes using frequency. we can also reduce numeric values through sampling.\n","\n","Normalization and standardization are special cases of Discretization that we'll talk about in a bit. To learn more in depth about binning, go [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-preprocessing-with-python-pandas-part-5-binning-c5bd5fd1b950).
